# QwickFix-Home-Services

This README.md file provides instructions for setting up and running the project. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): This is included with Node.js installation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Navin-S-Patil/QwickFix-Home-Service
    ```

2. Navigate to the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the client application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will launch the client application in your default web browser.

## Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server will start, and you should see relevant log messages indicating that the server is running.

Now, both the client and backend are up and running. You can access the application through your web browser and interact with the features provided.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed for your specific use case. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation or seek help from the project community.
